"""
As a template, this file helps implement the refresh_compile_commands rule and is not part of the user interface. See ImplementationReadme.md for top-level context -- or refresh_compile_commands.bzl for narrower context.

Interface (after template expansion):
- `bazel run` to regenerate compile_commands.json, so autocomplete (and any other clang tooling!) reflect the latest Bazel build files.
    - No arguments are needed; info from the rule baked into the template expansion.
        - Any arguments passed are interpreted as arguments needed for the builds being analyzed.
    - Requires being run under Bazel so we can access the workspace root environment variable.
- Output: a compile_commands.json in the workspace root that clang tooling (or you!) can look at to figure out how files are being compiled by Bazel
    - Crucially, this output is de-Bazeled; The result is a command that could be run from the workspace root directly, with no Bazel-specific requirements, environment variables, etc.
